Stock predictor - using historical prices, predicts the next 40 years' worth of stock price data using Monte Carlo simulations
and Brownian motion.
Allows users to input financial parameters such as Financial Goal, Starting Portfolio, Target Savings per year etc.
For given input parameters, calculates expected portfolio values across performance scenarios (5th / 50th / 95th percentiles)
AND across various distributions of US Treasuries (VUSTX), Equity Index Funds (VTSMX) and Individual Stocks (COKE), using
the Monte Carlo simulation data.
